# Employee Time Tracking and Payroll System

This project simulates a payroll system for 20 employees over a 5-day workweek. 
The purpose was to automate time tracking, pay calculations, and department assignment using Excel. 
I used functions like VLOOKUP, IF, INDEX, and RANDBETWEEN to calculate regular and overtime pay based on randomized clock-in/out times. 
The project demonstrates structured data handling, logic-based pay systems, and time formatting.

**Skills Used:**
- VLOOKUP, IF, INDEX, RANDBETWEEN
- Time formatting and automation
- Error troubleshooting
