# Employee Time Tracking and Payroll System

This project simulates a payroll system for 20 employees over a 5-day workweek. 
The purpose was to automate time tracking, pay calculations, and department assignment using Excel. 
I used functions like VLOOKUP, IF, INDEX, and RANDBETWEEN to calculate regular and overtime pay based on randomized clock-in/out times. 
The project demonstrates structured data handling, logic-based pay systems, and time formatting.

**Skills Used:**
- VLOOKUP, IF, INDEX, RANDBETWEEN
- Time formatting and automation
- Error troubleshooting

# SQL-Based STD Trends Analysis (1996â€“2008)

This project analyzes U.S. STD data from 1996 to 2008 using a dataset called std1.std_cases. The goal was to explore trends across disease types, demographics (age and gender), and geography (states and populations). I wrote SQL queries to identify patterns over time, compare infection rates by state and demographic groups, and interpret high-level public health insights. The project demonstrates SQL-based data segmentation, grouping, filtering, and aggregation.
